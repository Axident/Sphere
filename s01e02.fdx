    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>A young woman stands at the sink removing a toothbrush and toothpaste from the medicine cabinet. She closes the door and takes the cap off the toothpaste, dropping the cap in the garbage next to the pedestal sink. She lets out a small disappointed sigh and reaches into the garbage for the cap. She's surprised to find a black envelope with a silver seal on the font, lying in the bottom of the bin.</Text>

      <Text>Yes, we have satisfying but remarkably underpaid careers, a mountain of student loan debt, a tiny apartment and a used car that will take us another 3 years to pay off.

      <Text>Doesn't it strike you as the least bit suspicious that they apparently receive no communication from the outside at all? How strange is it that they never mention missing a single thing about our world? How all of their messages address us in the past tense, like they've dismissed this world as a bad dream? </Text>

      <Text>And after 57 years of candidates, not a single one of them complained. Don't you think the option must exist? Certainly one of the hundreds of people they've invited would've said something about wishing they could leave if that was on their mind. </Text>

      <Text>A random grenade starts bouncing down the stairs toward them. Guard 2 races over to it, picks it up and attempts to throw it down the tunnel. The grenade barely leaves his hand before it explodes. Aaron is thrown back against the wall. Smoke and shrapnel fill the air. Pieces of Guard 2's arm land on the stairs. His arm, part of his head, and a chunk of his upper torso are missing. He leans against the wall looking at Aaron. Somehow he is still able to talk.</Text>

      <Text>The docks are at the base of a massive cylindrical structure, built inside an impossibly huge hangar. Catwalks reach out from the walls of the silo in every direction. A moat-like ring of water surrounds the foot of it. And just past that, are armed men and women engaged in a frenzied fire-fight. Sentry turrets seem to have them pinned down for a moment, until a well tossed grenade destroys it in a brilliant ball of lightning. One of the machines Guard 2 described rounds the corner and rolls through the fray. Some of the laser fire bounces harmlessly off the large dark blue cases on the trailer behind it. He watches it's path and sees it pass unimpeded through a steel doorway past the fighting. Aaron makes his way along the edge of some large barrels, boxes and pipes trying to stay hidden. He watches for his opportunity to sneak past with one of the machines. Suddenly he's noticed by a woman in blue body armor.</Text>
