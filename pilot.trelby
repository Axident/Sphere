.\INt. Small Apartment Bathroom
>.A young woman stands at the sink removing a toothbrush and
>.toothpaste from the medicine cabinet. She closes the door
>.and takes the cap off the toothpaste, dropping the cap in
>.the garbage next to the pedestal sink. She lets out a small
>.disappointed sigh and reaches into the garbage for the cap.
>.She's surprised to find a black envelope with a silver seal
..on the font, lying in the bottom of the bin.
.\Int. Small apartment Bedroom
>.The room is cramped, barely enough space for the bed,
>.dresser and nightstand that occupy it. Through the thin
..curtains, streetlights can be seen changing color.
>.A young man is lying on the bed watching T.V. The bathroom
>.door swings open as the young woman stomps into the room
..with her outstretched hand holding the envelope. 
._Ivy
>:Aaron, what the hell? You threw
.:this away?
>.Aaron sits up in bed and mutes the T.V. He pauses, looking
..for the words.
._Aaron
.:I just... I just can't. 
._IVY
>:You can't what? You can't accept
>:how gifted you are? How much you
>:deserve this? You can't believe you
.:were chosen?
>.Aaron just shakes his head as Ivy sits down on the bed next
..to him and continues.
.:
._IVY
>:Believe it! You were picked! It
>:wasn't some Nobel Laureate, or
>:famous rock star, it's you they
.:want! 
._AARON
>:They don't want me. They want the
>:person they think I am... or might
.:be.
._IVY
.:What's that supposed to mean?
._AARON
.:Nothing.
..Aaron stares emotionless at the violence on T.V.
._AARON
.:I'm not interested.
>.Ivy sets the envelope on the small nightstand next to the
>.bed and grabs the remote. She flicks off the T.V. and puts
..her hand on his face.
._IVY
.:Look at me. What's going on?
>.Aaron turns to look Ivy in they eye. He forces a small
..smile.
._AARON
.:You know it's a one-way trip right?
._IVY
>:We talked about this. I'm ok with
>:that. As long as we're together, I
>:don't care. My friends will
>:understand. Your friends will be
.:thrilled for you! 
._AARON
>:And what if it's not the paradise
>:everyone thinks it is? At least in
.:this world, we know what we've got!
._IVY
>:Yes, we have satisfying but
>:remarkably underpaid careers, a
>:mountain of student loan debt, a
>:tiny apartment and a used car that
>:will take us another 3 years to pay
>:off. Neither of us have any family
>:or any real reason to stay. I
>:thought you were excited about the
>:idea when you filled out the
.:application?
._AARON
>:I had to fill that out. It was a
>:condition of my employment at the
.:University.
._IVY
>:Don't give me that, we sat up all
>:night when you finished the
>:paperwork. Remember how we tried to
>:picture how it must be in there? No
>:pollution, no illness, no rent, no
>:bills ever again? Every message
>:ever sent from every single
>:candidate has told of glorious
>:lifestyles with fantastic food and
>:dream jobs with no commutes! What's
.:not to like?
._AARON
.((sitting up)
>:Doesn't it strike you as the least
>:bit suspicious that they apparently
>:receive no communication from the
>:outside at all? How strange is it
>:that they never mention missing a
>:single thing about our world? How
>:all of their messages address us in
>:the past tense, like they've
>:dismissed this world as a bad
.:dream? 
._IVY
>:But they haven't! They keep giving
>:us fantastic advancements! Without
>:them we'd never have cured
>:Alzheimer's or developed salt water
>:power plants that actually create
>:fresh water. Think about what it
>:must be like in there? Would you
>:want to come back here? I'm sure
>:this world does feel like a bad
.:dream to them.
._AARON
>:And what if we do miss this world?
>:What if we find ourselves for some
>:reason longing for the
>:imperfections? What if we're not
>:ourselves without the struggle? Are
.:we allowed to change our minds?
._IVY
>:It wouldn't be much of a paradise
.:if they wouldn't let you out. 
._AARON
.:No. It definitely would not.
._IVY
>:And after 57 years of candidates,
>:not a single one of them
>:complained. Don't you think the
>:option must exist? Certainly one of
>:the hundreds of people they've
>:invited would've said something
>:about wishing they could leave if
.:that was on their mind. 
..Aaron shrugs.
._Ivy
>:We've seen countless sincere videos
>:delivered from them over the years.
>:Every one of them a joyous
>:explanation of how fantastic their
>:new lives are. Detailed
>:documentation of their homes and
.:the park-like spaces in-between. 
._AARON
>:You honestly think that if someone
>:wanted to leave, they could just
.:walk out?
._IVY
>:They could, they just don't want
>:to. Think about who we're talking
>:about: every one of them has been
>:someone with few ties to this
>:place. They made their
>:contribution, exclaimed that they
>:would prefer to be left alone and
.:got their wish. 
._AARON
.:Why me then?
._IVY
>:Are you kidding? Your thesis is
>:blowing people's minds. Everyone at
>:the U is talking about it. And I'm
.:sure they've seen it on the inside.
._AARON
.((nodding)
>:And now they want the guy who wrote
.:it.
._IVY
.((smiling)
.:And his wonderful fiancée. 
>.Aaron smiles back for a moment. Then his smile fades into a
..more serious expression. He looks directly into her eyes
._AAROn
.:Forever.
._IVY
.:Forever.
._AARON
.:And if we want out?
._IVY
.:We'll walk out.
._AARON
.:Okay.
._IVY
.:Really?
._AARON
>:Hand me the envelope. Let's do
.:this!
._IVY
.:Oh my god, this is so exciting!
>.Ivy grabs the envelope off the nightstand and starts to tear
>.it open. It refuses to open. She laughs and tries harder,
..but the envelope will not be opened.
._AARON
.:Trouble?
._IVY
>:It's made of something stronger
.:than it looks! Try it!
>.She hands the envelope over to Aaron. Aaron pulls at the
..corner with no effect. Ivy laughs.
._IVY
.:See! It's indestructible!
._AARON
.:No, it's just child proof!
>.Aaron and Ivy laughs together while Aaron picks at the
..silver seal on the front.
._IVY
.:Maybe it's biometric?
._AARON
.:Like a phone?
>.Aaron flips the envelope over in his hand and holds it like
>.a phone, with his index finger on the seal. The message is
..revealed in silver type on the front of the envelope.
._Message
>:At your earliest convenience,
>:please stand with whatever items
>:you find irreplaceable at
>:coordinates 41.89207, -87.59873.
>:You and one guest are welcome
.:inside.
>.Aaron and Ivy stare blankly at the words on the envelope for
..a moment. Then the words fade away.
._IVY
.:Wait! Hold on, let me get a pen!
..Ivy scrambles for a piece of paper and a pen.
._AARON
.:It's ok, look -
..He puts his finger back on the seal and the words return.
._IVY
>:Hold still, there's a lot of
.:numbers. 
>.She writes down the entire message on the back of an old
..birthday card.
..Aaron thinks out loud as she writes.
._AARON
>:Irreplaceable? What would that
.:include?
._IVY
.:You mean besides me?
..Ivy laughs and picks up her phone.
._IVY
>:Probably your phone. I bet it won't
>:work, but it's got all your stuff
.:on it.
._AARON
>:Most of it's in the cloud, but
>:you're right. I should download as
>:much as I can on my laptop. What
.:are you doing with your phone?
._IVY
>:I'm going to call Sasha, but first
>:I want to see where those
.:coordinates are. 
._AARON
>:I'm sure its the end of the pier.
>:Don't you think it's a bit late to
.:be making phone calls?
._IVY
>:You're right, it's the pier. Of
>:course it's where everyone else
>:went. I guess I thought sometimes
.:it was different places. 
..She closes the map and dials her friend.
._AARON
.:Are you really calling Sasha now?
._IVY
>((nodding and adding a
.(sarcastic look)
>:Um, we're going into the sphere,
.:yeah - she'll be fine. 
./fade to: 
.\Int.compact car on the freeway
>.It's dark out and traffic is still subsiding from the
>.evening rush hour. Aaron is driving with Ivy through
>.downtown Chicago. He's watching his phone attached to the
>.dashboard for directions. The freeway is cut like a channel
>.through city; there are 15 foot tall concrete walls on
..either side of the road.
._AARON
>:Now I remember why I never come
.:down here.
._IVY
>:This isn't so bad, the traffic
.:would've been way worse earlier.
._AARON
>:True. Do you think we should've
.:called an Uber?
._IVY
>:I thought you wanted to drive, in
>:case... you know, we don't get
.:another chance.
._AARON
>:I'm pretty sure the traffic inside
.:is fully automated.
._IVY
.:Why?
._AARON
>:Because their technology is just so
>:far advanced. We're going to have
>:fully automated cars soon, I'm sure
>:it's something they've had for
.:years.
._IVY
>:Why do you think they only give us
>:help once in a while, instead of
.:sharing all their cool tech?
._AARON
>:They probably think we'd blow
.:ourselves up or something.
._IVY
.((unsatisfied)
.:Hm. This is our turn.
._Phone
>:Use the right lane to take the next
.:exit.
._AARON
.((laughing)
.:Thanks, both of you!
./cut to: 
.\EXT. Parking lot at the base of the navy pier
>.The headlights of a car make a wide arc through the nearly
>.empty parking lot. Aaron parks near the beginning of the
>.walkway down the pier. As Aaron and Ivy get out and begin to
>.gather their things, headlights from the only other car in
>.the parking lot shine directly on them. The car rolls up
>.diagonally across the neighboring spaces behind them and
>.stops just a few feet away. With the engine still running
..and the lights on, both doors open on the dark boxy vehicle.
._FBI Agent
.:Aaron Ballenski?
._AARON
>((shielding his eyes from
.(the lights)
.:Who's asking?
._IVY
.:Aaron!
>.The agents walk around the front of the car so they can be
..seen. The driver holds out a badge for a moment.
._FBI AGENT
>:We're with the FBI, we'd like to
.:ask you a few questions.
._AARON
>:The FBI? Seriously? Did I do
.:something wrong?
._FBI AGENT
>:We have reason to believe you're in
>:possession of an invitation to
.:leave the United States.
._AARON
>:Yes, sir. Am I in trouble for
.:leaving?
._FBI AGENT
>:Not at all, we monitor this site
>:and ask everyone who leaves a few
>:basic questions. Do you have the
.:invitation on your person?
._AARON
.:I do, do you want to see it?
._FBI AGENT
.:I would.
._AARON
>:Hold on, I have it right here...
.:somewhere.
>.Aaron begins to dig through the duffel bag he has slung over
..his shoulder.
._IVY
.:I have it. Here you go.
>.Ivy pulls the envelope out of her handbag and holds it out
..to the agent.
._AARON
.:Ivy? Why do you have it?
._IVY
.:I was afraid you'd forget it!
._AARON
.:That's fair.
>.The Agent turns the paper over in his hands and nods to the
..other agent.
._FBI AGENT
.:Can I keep this?
._AARON
.:I'm about to need it.
._FBI AGENT
>:They know you're coming. It's not
>:necessary to have it on your person
.:when they take you.
._AARON
.:When they take me?
._FBI AGENT
.:Do you know what's about to happen?
._AARON
.:Not really...
._FBI AGENT
>:When you reach the location they
>:gave you on this envelope, you and
>:all your stuff is taken instantly
.:inside.
._AARON
.:Yeah, I've seen that on T.V.
._FBI AGENT
>:Do you ever see anyone present an
.:envelope?
._AARON
.:I guess not, no.
._FBI AGENT
>:You won't need it. Chances are, you
.:won't need any of this.
._AARON
>:I might, some if this is important
.:to me.
._FBI AGENT
.:How much cash are you bringing?
._AARON
>:Oh  not very much at all, actually.
>:Do you think I'll need a lot of
.:money?
._FBI AGENT
.:How much is not much?
..Aaron pulls out his wallet and starts to count the bills.
._AARON
.:Looks like about 60 bucks.
._FBI AGENT
>:That's all I needed to know, thank
.:you.
._AARON
>:You don't care about the rest of
.:this stuff?
._FBI AGENT
>:The rest isn't really my
.:jurisdiction. 
._AARON
.:I see.
._FBI AGENt
.:Good night, folks. Good luck.
..The agents turn and get back in their car. 
>.Aaron watches them for a moment as they back into a parking
>.spot before he returns to unpacking the car. He pulls out a
>.backpack and stacks his duffel bag onto his wheeled luggage.
>.Ivy throws a bag over her shoulder and pulls her own wheeled
>.luggage out from the back seat. They shut the doors and take
>.a moment to accept this might be the last time they see
>.their car. Aaron takes the keys and puts them in a
..magnetized box under the driver's side door. 
._IVY
.:Eric knows where to find that?
._AARON
.:I hope so. In three days, it's his.
./cut to:

._IVY
.:Seriously? This closes?

._IVY
.:Wow. Just look at it.
._AARON
>:I remember being terrified of it as

._IVY
.:Why? It's so beautiful?
._AARON
>:The first time I saw it was on a

>:The air force was freaking out.
>:They tried to shoot it down and

.:landed, most of downtown flooded.
._IVY
.:I don't think they meant any harm.
._AARON
>:Well people died, it was a chaotic

._IVY
.:This is it.

._IVY
.:Are you ok?
._AARON
.((slowly)
>:Yeah. I just want to make sure we

>:myself things like "Did we forget

._IVY
>:We took care of absolutely

>:everyone. Anything we forgot will
.:be ok. 
._AAROn
>:You're right. You're totally right.
>:We've already made up our minds.
>:Let's find out where this road

._AAROn
.:This is it!
._IVY

._AARON
>:Um, yeah. Wait, where am I? What's

._LAWYER
>:You're about to be put on trial for

._AARON
>:What trial? What happened? Where's
.:Ivy?
._LAWYER
>:Your actions have lead to a fractal

>:is a very serious crime. Do you

._AARON
>:No. I have no idea what you're

._LAWYER
>:She's not been implicated in the

._AARON
>:For what? I just got here, you've
.:got me confused with somebody else!
._LAWYER
>:I'm sure from your perspective it
>:seems like you just got here, but
>:you were activated days ago. Since

>:escaped through the World Gate.
>:From there you allegedly broke many

.:Time travel? Are you kidding me?

>:Yes, I know it can be a lot to

._AARON
>:Why don't I remember any of this?

..Aaron struggles against the straps to no avail.
._LAWYER
>:Under normal circumstances, people
>:save restore points we call
>:"images" on the city mainframe in
>:case of catastrophic damage. If the
>:body is somehow destroyed we can
>:construct a new copy from the last
>:image. Since you never made another
>:restore point - the only one on
>:file was from your original
>:transfer to the city. So we built
.:you from that image. 
._AARON
>:So you're saying this isn't even
.:the first body you've copied of me?
._LAWYER
>:Since the actions you're accused of
>:have caused a fractal disruption in
>:the time-line, it's impossible to
.:say how many copies there are.
._AARON
>:What are you saying? What happened
.:to me?
>.A massive blast rocks the building. The explosion shakes the
>.room and the lights flicker. A loud fire alarm rings out and
>.yellow flashing lights illuminate the room through the
>.windows facing the hallway. Two robotic humanoid guards
>.enter the room with what appear to be large automatic
>.weapons in their black metallic hands. Despite their obvious
>.mechanical construction, they move and sound remarkably like
..humans.
._GUARD 1
>:This building is being evacuated.
.:We will escort you to safety.
._OFFICER
>:This subject is awaiting immediate
.:trial and cannot be moved off-site.
._LAWYER
>:I'll take responsibility for him,
.:he doesn't even know where he is.
._OFFICER
>:That is unacceptable. (to one of
>:the guards) Terminate the subject,
>:we'll rebuild him for when the
.:trial is rescheduled.
._LAWYER
.((to Aaron)
.:Ugh, sorry buddy. I tried.
>.Guard 1 leads the Officer and the Lawyer out of the room.
..Guard 2 arms his rifle and watches them leave.
._AARON
.((yelling after them)
>:You can't do this! I didn't do
.:anything!
._Guard 2
.:Ah, but you did.
>.Guard 2 checks for others in either direction of the hallway
..and then walks over to Aaron's chair.
._AARON
>:Please no, this is a terrible
.:mistake!
._GUARD 2
>:You may not know it, but you are
>:uniquely qualified to save millions
.:of people. 
>.Guard 2 holsters his rifle and bends over to release Aaron's
..legs at the base of the chair.
._AARON
>:What are you talking about? You're
.:not going to kill me?
._GUARD 2
>:Nothing can kill you Aaron, your
>:body is already dead. Will you
>:trust me while I attempt to aid
.:your escape?
>.Guard 2 pauses at Aaron's wrist restraints and waits for an
..answer. Aaron anxiously watches for his hands to be freed.
._AARON
.:Yes, absolutely!
>.The moment Guard 2 removes the wrist restraints Aaron snaps
>.to his feet. He pushes past Guard 2 and runs to the door.
>.Without hesitation he chooses to run left out of the doorway
..and down the hall. 
.\Int. Sterile White hallway
>.Aaron slows down to turn a corner when the wheel chair
>.catches up to him from behind and he slams back into the
>.seat. The chair continues forward, much faster than he was
>.running. Guard 2 is pushing it while running at an
..astonishing pace.
._GUARD 2
>:Please remain seated, Aaron. I'll
>:do what I can to ensure your
.:safety.
>.Aaron mutters a few curse words while the chair rockets down
>.the hall. They pass a few people in uniform who are unable
>.to do more than yell at them as they pass. The Guard
>.continues to push Aaron to an intersection, rounds the
>.corner and continues down the next hall to an elevator. The
>.robot grabs the wheels suddenly and locks them up,
..screeching to a halt precisely at the elevator doors.
._GUARD 2
>:Would you mind pushing the call
.:button, Aaron?
>.Aaron only turns to look at the Guard in shock. Guard 2
>.reaches over Aaron with the end of his rifle and calmly
>.pushes the down arrow. There is only a brief moment of
>.silence before the doors open. The Guard pushes Aaron
>.inside, next to a man and woman both wearing similar brown
>.jump-suits as Aaron's Lawyer. Aaron tries not to look at
>.either one of them. The doors close, the car begins to
..descend.
.\Int.INside the elevator
._Man in elevator
.:Where are you taking this one?
._GUARD 2
.:Judgement.
._Woman in elevator
.:Shouldn't he be strapped in?
>.Instantly the Guard grabs his rifle and fires a short blue
>.pulse at both of the other occupants in the elevator. They
..drop to the floor without a sound. Aaron jumps to his feet.
._AARON
.:Holy shit! What the hell?
._GUARD 2
.:They are not permanently injured.
>.The Guard opens his palm on the elevator control panel. The
>.floor indicator switches over to an override interface. The
..new floor choice is labeled "Authorised Personnel Only".
._AARON
>:Wow, just... wow. What did you
.:shoot them with?
._GUARD 2
.:A particle accelerator.
._AARON
.:What? What year is this?
>.The elevator stops and the doors begin to open. The Guard
>.pushes the wheelchair into the back of Aaron's legs, once
..again forcing him to sit.
._GUARD 2
>:This will go better if you remain
.:seated.
.\Int. An underground parking structure
>.The walls, ceiling and floor are all made of reinforced
>.concrete. At the far side of the structure there is a wide
>.ramp where daylight pours in. There are traditional looking
>.pipes and fire sprinkler systems attached to the ceiling
>.above them, over rows of electric law enforcement vehicles.
>.There are bikes, cars and SUV's parked wall to wall. A Guard
>.similar to Guard 2 is walking towards them as they roll out
>.into the garage. Guard 2 wheels Aaron to the passenger door
..of a sporty looking black and white sedan. 
._GUARD 2
.:Get in.
._AARON
.:Should I get in back?
._GUARD 2
.:I need you in front.
>.The guard walks around to the driver's side door and opens
>.it. Aaron gets up out of the chair and grabs the door
..handle.
._AARON
>:Won't it look more authentic if I
.:get in back?
._GUARD 2
>:The doors in back don't open from
>:the inside. If I am destroyed, I
>:need you to be capable of
.:continuing on foot.
.\Int. Inside the vehicle
>.The Guard sits down in the car and shuts the door. Aaron
>.moves aside a small pile of clothes takes his seat next to
..him in the front.
._AARON
.:Why would you be destroyed?
._GUARD 2
>:I may be unable to escort you all
>:the way to our destination. The
>:clothes that were on your seat, put
.:them on.
>.The Guard starts the car apparently with some internal
>.mechanism. There is no steering wheel or any visible means
>.of physically driving this car. There is a large touch
>.screen device attached to the dashboard between them. A map
..with a red dot suddenly appears on the screen.
._GUARD 2
>:This is where you need to be in 11
>:minutes and 6 seconds. You will be
>:noticed in that prisoner outfit,
.:please put on the clothes.
>.Aaron unfolds a white jumpsuit and begins to pull it up over
..his bright orange shorts.
.\Int.Underground Parking Structure
>.Guard 2 pulls forward out of the parking spot and rolls to
>.the exit ramp. The Guard they passed while walking to the
>.elevator watches them for a moment, then returns to it's
..car.
.\INT. INSIDE THE VEHICLE - Day
._AARON
>:I still don't understand. Are we in
.:danger?
._GUARD 2
>:We're being followed. There is a
>:high probability of a car chase in
>:the next few moments. This may be
>:the only chance I have to explain
.:so please pay attention.
._AARON
.:Please do, I'm so confused.
>.Aaron tries to get a better look behind them at the car
..following them.
._GUARD 2
>:This city is a portal to another
>:world, many light years away from
>:this place. The residents of the
>:other world are born of machines.
>:Their bodies are like yours, but
>:their minds are limited to existing
>:knowledge. They are not, and can
>:never be creative. They use this
>:city to harvest creative minds from
>:the living population of earth.
>:Once acclimated to this city, new
>:residents are transferred off world
>:to make room for new arrivals.
>:Population control is a critical
.:element of their success.
._AARON
>:Off world? Where is this other
.:planet?
.\Ext. The streets of the city - Day
>.This city looks much like most American cities at the street
>.level. There are storefronts and pedestrians. A moderate
>.amount of vehicle traffic. All vehicles are electric and
>.computer controlled, eliminating the need for traffic
>.signals. They pass through several intersections without
>.slowing down; so does the cross traffic. Almost magically
..everyone misses each other.
.\INT. INSIDE THE VEHICLE - Day
._GUARD 2
>:The planet is not a rocky body like
>:this one. It has a massive surface
>:area, many times larger than
>:anything your scientists have
.:discovered.
._AARON
>:Why haven't we seen this massive
>:world? We're discovering Earth
.:sized planets all the time now?
._GUARD 2
.:It hasn't been constructed yet.
..The car begins to accelerate. Several cars are passed.
._AARON
>:Wait, how are people being sent to
.:a planet that doesn't exist yet?
._GUARD 2
>:The World Gate permits the travel
>:between great distances in both
.:space and time.
.\EXT. THE STREETS OF THE CITY - Day
>.The car narrowly misses a truck as it races through the next
>.intersection. They rocket past another row of cars and
>.squeal around the corner. The police car following them has
..no trouble keeping up, and seems to be gaining on them.
.\INT. INSIDE THE VEHICLE - Day
._GUARD 2
>:I won't be able to maintain control
.:of this vehicle for much longer.
._AARON
>:You seem to be doing pretty good to
.:me!
._GUARD 2
>:They're attempting to override, we
>:need to get out range of their
.:signal.
._AARON
.:Is there anything I can do?
._GUARD 2
>:If you remain conscious after the
>:crash look for me. If I'm not
>:there, use the map to get to the
.:Gate.
._AARON
.:Wait, what crash?
.\EXT. THE STREETS OF THE CITY - DAY
>.The car suddenly swerves off the main road and onto the
>.sidewalk. Several pedestrians dive out of the way as they
>.zip past. In the center of a plaza with a large fountain, a
>.wide stairwell goes down into a mass transit hub. The car
>.smashes through a concrete planter and dives down the
>.stairwell. It crash lands onto the first of 2 large landings
..and stops suddenly against the handrail. 
.\Int. Stairwell leading into the metro station
>.Broken glass and smoke fill the landing, people are running
>.and screaming. The passenger side door opens. Then the
>.driver's side. The guard steps out and watches Aaron grab
..the touchpad from the dashboard and stumble to his feet.
._GUARD 2
.:That went better than I expected.
._AARON
.:Seriously? 
.. Sirens can be heard outside.
._GUARD 2
.:Time to go.
>.Aaron follows Guard 2 as they run down the remaining stairs
>.into the station. At the base of the stairs there are no
>.turnstiles or guard stations. Just a platform where people
>.would wait for the train. There is an unmarked door just
>.before where the hallway opens out to the platform. Guard 2
..places his palm on the screen next to the door and it opens.
._GUARD 2
.:This way!
.\Int. Dark hallway
>.The hallway is completely black, no light at all. Guard 2
>.suddenly snaps on a head mounted light source that shows an
..empty tile floor leading into the darkness.
._AARON
.:Where are we?
._GUARD 2
>:This is a maintenance tunnel for
>:machines. We can see in the dark,
>:but I'll leave this light on for
.:your convenience.
._AARON
>:How thoughtful of you. How much
.:time do we have?
._GUARD 2
>:There is an entrance to the train
>:tunnel around the next corner. From
>:there it's a 4 minute run to the
>:next stop. That stop is at the base
.:of the World Gate.
.\Int. Train tunnel
>.The train tunnel is empty except for a 2 metal rails running
>.down the center. The ledge on the side is barely wide enough
>.for Aaron and the Guard to run. They are moving incredibly
..fast.
._AARON
>:How can I run this fast? I'm not
.:even tired!
._GUARD 2
>:You will eventually overcome your
>:energy stores at this pace, but not
.:before we reach our destination.
._AARON
.:How much farther?
._GUARD 2
.:That light up ahead is it.
.\Int. Train platform
>.Aaron and the Guard run onto the platform from the dark
>.tunnel. There are no trains, no people, just an empty tile
>.floor and a few concrete columns. Laser blasts and small
>.explosions can be heard from the top of the stairs. A battle
..rages just beyond their view.
._AARON
.:What the hell is going on up there?
._GUARD 2
.:This will be the hard part.
._AARON
>:This? Like getting to this point
.:was a cake walk?
._GUARD 2
>:At the top of the stairs, are
>:people who are willing to give
>:their lives to protect you. Some of
.:them no doubt already have.
._AARON
>:That's not possible, I don't even
.:know anyone here.
._GUARD 2
>:Please pay attention, we have less
.:than 3 minutes.
._AARON
.:I'm listening.
._GUARD 2
>:Just beyond where the sentries are
>:shooting, there will be a series of
>:automated carts moving cargo to the
>:bay for transfer. Those cargo
>:containers are heavy and
>:impenetrable. They'll make good
>:cover for you to make your way to
>:safety. I will provide cover fire
.:while you make your way past.
._AARON
.:You're not coming with me?
._GUARD 2
>:Your chances of boarding the ship
>:are greatly increased if I can draw
>:fire away from you. Ideally, you
>:won't even be noticed. Are you
.:ready?
._AARON
>:Board the ship? This is crazy! All
>:I want to do is get away from this
>:madness. I need to find Ivy and
.:leave!
._GUARD 2
>:The timeline where you board that
>:ship is the only one where you see
.:Ivy again. You must do this.
>.A random grenade starts bouncing down the stairs toward
>.them. Guard 2 races over to it, picks it up and attempts to
>.throw it down the tunnel. The grenade barely leaves his hand
>.before it explodes. Aaron is thrown back against the wall.
>.Smoke and shrapnel fill the air. Pieces of Guard 2's arm
>.land on the stairs. His arm, part of his head, and a chunk
>.of his upper torso are missing. He leans against the wall
..looking at Aaron. Somehow he is still able to talk.
._GUARD 2
>:You must go. (broken digitized
>:audio sounds) I'll be right behind
.:you.
._AARON
.:This is so fucked up.
>.Aaron starts up the stairs looking for the source of the
..grenade.
.\Int. World Gate cargo docks
>.The docks are at the base of a massive cylindrical
>.structure, built inside an impossibly huge hangar. Catwalks
>.reach out from the walls of the silo in every direction. A
>.moat-like ring of water surrounds the foot of it. And just
>.past that, are armed men and women engaged in a frenzied
>.fire-fight. Sentry turrets seem to have them pinned down for
>.a moment, until a well tossed grenade destroys it in a
>.brilliant ball of lightning. One of the machines Guard 2
>.described rounds the corner and rolls through the fray. Some
>.of the laser fire bounces harmlessly off the large dark blue
>.cases on the trailer behind it. He watches it's path and
>.sees it pass unimpeded through a steel doorway past the
>.fighting. Aaron makes his way along the edge of some large
>.barrels, boxes and pipes trying to stay hidden. He watches
>.for his opportunity to sneak past with one of the machines.
..Suddenly he's noticed by a woman in blue body armor.
._Woman in armor
>:Aaron?!? What the hell are you
.:doing here?
._AARON
.:I thought this was the way out?
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
>:You got turned around, its the
.:other way.
>.She points down the hallway where Aaron came from. Suddenly
>.a tank-like machine rolls around the corner just past where
>.she's pointing. It fires a short burst of gunfire at her
>.armor. She gets knocked back a step and the lurches forward
..tackling Aaron. 
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
.:Shit! Hide in here!
>.She gives Aaron a small shove through a doorway marked
>."Quarantine Cargo Hold". She attempts to return fire on the
>.machine but it launches a rocket at her. She dives into the
>.room with Aaron as the rocket explodes farther down the
..docks.
.\Int. Quarantine Cargo Hold
>.The small white room is mostly empty, except for 2 of the
..dark blue crates they saw on the cargo mover outside.
._AARON
.:What is that thing?
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
>:B-48: X class. I don't have what I
.:need to take it down. 
._AARON
.:What can I do?
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
>:Lets see if there's anything useful
.:in those crates.
>.Aaron watches the woman slide open a control panel on the
>.nearest crate revealing a grid of glowing buttons. She
..presses one of them and begins opening her crate.
>.The crate near Aaron has a similar panel. Aaron kneels down
>.and examines the buttons. He presses one marked "unseal".
..His crate slowly opens.
>.Inside the case he finds a series of gas canisters with
..bio-hazard symbols on them. 
._aaron
>:Damn, that's not good. What'd you
.:get?
..Aaron shuts the case and presses the seal button.
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
>:Atomic printer. If we had more time
>:and a power source, we could build
>:whatever we wanted. How about
.:yours?
>.Just then, a grenade rolls up to the room, inches outside
..the open door.
._AARON
.((pointing)
.:Grenade!
>.The woman jumps to the door controller and smashes the
>.button with her fist. Steel double doors with windows slam
..shut, less than a second before the grenade explodes.
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
.:Fuck, that was close!
>.Through the windows, the tank like machine can be seen
..rolling up to the door.
._AARON
.:It's still coming!
>.The machine slams into the door and makes a significant
>.dent. The woman readies her weapon to fire at it as soon as
>.it enters. It crashes into the door again, making the dent
>.much worse. Sparks shower from the edges of the door
>.controller. Before the machine can make another blow, a ball
>.of lightning flashes in it's center for a moment - then it
>.explodes. As the smoke clears, Guard 2 steps into view. He's
>.a complete wreck, but still able to walk and use his
..remaining arm. 
._AARON
.:Hey, you made it!
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
.:No! Oh my god, no!
._GUARD 2
.:(slightly garbled) Time to go.
>.Guard 2 puts his palm on the panel outside the door. A
>.yellow light begins spinning in the center of the ceiling. A
..buzzing alarm starts ringing intermittently. 
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
>:No, no! You son of a bitch, you
.:can't do this to me!
>.Woman begins hopelessly hitting the button for the door, but
..it's too badly damaged to open. The buzzing alarm stops. 
._AARON
.:What's going on?
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
>:We're being transferred to the
.:ship's hold!
._AARON
.:Great! Isn't that good?
..The room begins to fill with a powerful white light.
._WOMAN IN ARMOR
.((surprised)
.:Who are you?
>.The light reaches a blinding level, followed by the
>.crackling water sounds Aaron heard only recently when he
..arrived.
>.When the light passes, Aaron and the Woman are standing near
>.the same crates as a moment before, but now the walls and
..lights are different.
.\Int.Ships quarantine cargo hold
>.This room is the same size, but the walls and floor are tan.
>.A persistent red flashing light is mounted on the wall. The
>.wall where the door was now has a working closed door and 2
>.large windows. A grey metal hallway lit with the same
>.flashing red light can be seen through the inches thick
>.glass. Aaron seems only mildly disoriented, but the woman
>.collapses to the floor. Aaron rushes over to her and
..attempts to wake her.
._AARON
>:Hey, stay with me! I think we're
.:going to be ok!
>.The Woman suddenly draws a deep breath and opens her eyes.
>.She looks at Aaron confused and then around the room, before
..attempting to sit up.
>.Suddenly the entire room seems to tilt and everything is
>.thrown to the far wall. The crates smash against each other
>.with incredible force. The tan metal walls are dented from
>.the impact. Aaron and the Woman are sent through the air
..like rag dolls, landing on top of the crates. 
>.They are unable to move before the room tilts again and
>.everything is sent to the adjacent wall. Aaron and the Woman
>.are thrown against the crates and the walls repeatedly as
..the room continues to make sudden wild shifts in momentum. 
>.Through the thick glass windows the metal hallway suddenly
>.explodes, sending chunks of metal out into a snowy landscape
>.now visible through the resulting hole in the wall. Random
>.small items are sucked out the gaping breach and fire roars
..at the edge of the window outside. 
>.An incredibly loud explosion shakes the room and for a
>.moment Aaron, the Woman, and both heavy blue crates are seen
>.floating weightless. The scene out the window shows
>.mountains, then sky, then snow, then mountains, then a huge
>.airship being destroyed in the air above them. The impact
..with the ground knocks Aaron out.
./CUT TO Black 
.@Act 3
.\Int. Destroyed remains of the cargo hold
>.The room is a burning pile of twisted metal and plastic. The
>.roof has been mostly torn off and the far wall is vertically
>.split in the center all the way down to the floor. Water is
>.trickling in and starting to pool near Aaron's head. Aaron
>.suddenly jolts awake. His head is bleeding and there are
..scorch marks on his clothes, but he seems otherwise in-tact.
>.He quickly checks himself out and then begins to search for
>.the Woman. She is laying crushed under one of the crates.
>.Aaron can see her arm and shoulder just above the rising
>.water line. He rushes over to her to see if she's still
>.alive. He lifts her head and can see her eyes are fixed,
..unblinking. 
>.Aaron desperately pushes his shoulder into the crate to see
>.if he can free her, but it doesn't move. He holds her head
>.in his hands for a moment and notices a pendant on a chain
>.around her neck. He lifts it out of the water and sees that
>.it has an inscription, "For Callie." He gently pulls off the
..necklace and lets her sink back into the rising water.
._AARON
.:I'm so sorry Callie.
.\Ext. The ice fields - dusk
>.Aaron climbs out of the wreckage and into the snowy
>.hillside. Once over the ridge he can see it's not a hillside
>.at all, but an impact crater. Whatever crashed here has made
>.bowl in the ice nearly 100 yards across in an otherwise flat
>.plane of ice and snow. The surrounding burning debris is
>.melting the snow causing the center to fill with water. Soon
>.the remains of the cargo hold that brought him here will be
>.completely submerged. The surrounding landscape is a bleak
>.white endless plane of ice and snow, now barely visible as
..the last of the daylight fades.
>.Aaron notices that despite the time of day, there isn't a
>.sunset. He looks up at the dimming sun in the center of the
>.sky to see why it's so dark out. As he watches it gets even
>.darker. He mutters to himself as it completely fades and
>.ultimately disappears. This is not a solar eclipse, the sun
..has simply gone out.
._AARON
>:Well shit. I guess eventually there
>:has to be a point where it actually
.:can't get any worse.
.\EXT. THE ICE FIELDS - NIGHT
>.In the darkness he can now make out a distant light source.
>.Without any other points of interest on the horizon, he
>.begins walking. The snow crunches under his simple
>.prison-issue shoes. He can see the light getting closer, but
>.almost nothing else. There is no moonlight, and the dim
>.starlight only hugs the edges of the horizon. The sky is
>.completely black. The only light he can make out comes from
>.some distant city over the horizon, and a smaller light
..source from what must be a building a few miles away.
.\Ext. Outside the ice racer Bar - night
>.The bar is a welcome site against the harsh frozen
>.landscape. It's a well lit 2 story building with smoke
>.rising from the chimney. Aaron can hear laughter and music
>.coming from within. Multiple complicated looking vehicles
..are half-hazardly parked outside. 
.\Int. Ice Racer bar - night
>.Inside the bar men and women are eating and drinking at
>.tables scattered throughout the room. They are wearing heavy
>.snow gear, with open jackets and padded pants. A long bar on
>.the far wall has multiple people eating and discussing
..technical specs of snow machines.
>.People take notice as Aaron walks into the room. His shaven
>.head and lightweight clothing make him look more than
>.different from everyone else here. Once he's noticed, people
>.end their conversations and stare. Soon the entire room is
>.quiet and watching him. One of the workers behind the bar
..begins pressing buttons on a wall panel.
._AARON
>:I'm sorry, did I do something
.:wrong?
>.A huge man with a pistol in his hand stands up and aims the
..weapon at Aaron.
._Man with gun
>:You know the rules asshole, no
.:Tourists! 
..Aaron raises his hands and takes a step back.
._AARON
.:I'm not a Tourist, I'm lost!
._MAN WITH GUN
>:Then we should send you back where
.:you came from, yeah?
._AARON
>:I honestly don't know if that's
.:even an option any more...

.:Oh yeah, that's an option.

.\EXT. OUTSIDE THE ICE RACER BAR - NIGHT
>.Aaron is dragged out of the bar into the area being used as

._AARON
>:Stop, please stop! I didn't do
.:anything!
>.The crowd ignores his pleas and wrap the chain around him,

>:I'm not a Tourist! I don't even
>:know what you're talking about!
>:Nobody was rebuilt, the thing
>:crashed and I walked here! That's

..Bike Cop 1 stands up and draws his side-arm. 
._AARON
>:Hey I told you everything I know!
.:I'm not who you think I am!
._BIKE COP 1
.:You're not who you think you are.
..Bike Cop 1 shoots Aaron in the leg.

._BIKE COP 1
>((still pointing the gun
.(at Aaron)
>:People don't survive crashes like
>:yours. Tourists don't either. But
.:they do get rebuilt.
._AARON
>:Rebuilt? I wasn't fucking rebuilt!
>:I woke up in the wreckage and
.:walked here.
._BIKE COP 1
>:You're being rebuilt right now, you
.:idiot. I can see you rebuilding!
>.Bike Cop 1 points his gun back down at Aaron's leg. The
..bullet hole is already closing. 
._BIKE COP 1
>:Are you going to at least admit
>:you're a Tourist, or do I have to
.:shoot you some more?
>.Aaron just stares at the wound in disbelief and watches it
..heal.
>.Bike Cop 2 exits the bar and rushes over with her helmet in
>.one hand, and her gun in the other. With her helmet off,
>.Aaron immediately recognizes her as Callie. She's unsure who
..just fired a gun.
._Callie
.:Hands where I can see 'em!
._BIKE COP 1
>:It's ok Callie, I think some fool
>:got a failed image. He's a total
.:blank. 
._AARON
.:Callie? It's you! You survived!
._BIKE COP 1
.:See? He's a total mess.
._Callie
.:How do you know my name?
._BIKE COP 1
>:I just called you by name, he's
.:desperate.
._AARON
>:No, I know you! You were on the
.:plane!
._BIKE COP 1
.((sarcastic)
>:But I wasn't? Just you two? How
.:romantic!
._AARON
>:I'm serious, look you had this
.:around your neck!
>.Aaron tries to reach into his pocket and both Cops train
..their weapons on his head.
._BIKE COP 1
.:Hands up! Don't do anything stupid!
._AARON
>:I'm not going to do anything! Just
.:look, it's in my pocket!
._Callie
>:Hold still, or you're gonna get
.:shot again.
>.Callie reaches down and loosens the chains around Aaron,
..enough for him to free himself.
._MIKE
.:What are you doing, Callie?
._CALLIE
.((to Aaron)
>:Turn around, put your hands on the
.:pole.
._BIKE COP 1
>:You don't actually believe him, do
.:you?
._Callie
>:We should know what he has in his
.:pocket before we bring him in.
._BIKE COP 1
.:Unless we just destroy him.
._CALLIE
>:Don't you want to know what he's
.:carrying?
._MIKE
.:Fair enough, search him.
>.Callie pats Aaron down and finds the necklace in his pocket.
..She slowly pulls it out and examines it.
._Callie
.:Holy shit, Mike look!
..She holds up the pendant so Mike can see it in the light.
._Mike
>:So he has a pendant like yours, do
.:we just let him go now?
._Callie
>:It's not just "like" mine, it's the
>:same! Look it has the same
.:inscription!
>.Mike leans forward and presses the gun to the back of
..Aaron's head.
._MIKE
.:Where did you get that?
._AARON
.((slowly)
>:From someone who was in the crash
>:with me. I can take you there if
.:you want.
._MIKE
.:How far?
._AARON
.:Just a few miles from here.
._MIKE
.:Which way?
._AARON
.((looking around)
>:Um, I'm not actually sure. I walked
.:here in the dark.
._Callie
.:I'll check local radar.
>.She goes over to her bike and presses some buttons on the
..dashboard. 
._MIKE
.:You better not be lying.
._AARON
.:I swear, it's not far.
..Callie returns from her bike and points into the darkness.
._Callie
>:There is a fading heat signature
.:about 6 miles west of here.
._MIKE
>:Start walking, we'll be right
.:behind you.
._AARON
.:You want me to walk?
._MIKE
>:It'll go faster if you run. I don't
>:care. We'll be on our bikes, which
>:can totally vaporize you if you try
.:anything.
._Callie
>:Mike please, just give him a
.:chance. 
>.The two Bike Cops get on their hover bikes and put their
>.helmets on. Aaron starts walking in the direction Callie
..pointed. 
._MIKE
.:Pick it up, let's go!
.\EXT. THE ICE FIELDS - night
>.Aaron starts to jog, then run. His leg doesn't seem to
>.bother him at all. In fact the frigid cold doesn't even
>.affect him. The snowy plane extends endlessly in front of
>.him, beyond the range of the headlights of the bikes. Their
..helmets offer clear 2-way communication while they ride.
._Callie
.:Wow, I wish I could run like that.
._MIKE
>:You could, if you were tired of
.:being a human. 
._Callie
>:Does it have to be like that
>:though? Isn't there a way they
>:could share their technology
>:without completely erasing a
.:person?
._MIKE
>:None that we've ever seen. All they
.:do is take.
._Callie
>:They gave us the cure to Morrison's
.:disease.
._MIKE
>:After they eliminated 3 entire
.:border colonies.
._Callie
.:True.
._MIKE
>:Don't get soft on them Callie, they
.:don't give a fuck about us.
._Callie
>:How do you think he got that
.:pendant?
._MIKE
.:Looks like we're about to find out.
>.Aaron runs fairly effortlessly for the entire 6 miles. Soon
>.they arrive at the remaining smoking embers of the wreckage.
>.A small fire still burns at the edge of the crater. The
>.silhouette of a person can be seen sitting in the fire's
..orange glow.
._MIKE
.:Hold it right there Tourist!
>.Mike swings his hover bike around between Aaron and the
..fire. Aaron slows to a stop.
._AARON
.:I have a name you know!
._Mike
.:I don't care.
..Callie rides over to the fire and climbs off her bike.
._Callie
.:Mike!
._AARON
>:Yeah I can tell, you've got me all
.:figured out.
._MIKE
>:That's right, you're a Tourist.
.:That's all I need to know.
._Callie
.((louder)
.:Mike!
._AARON
>:You don't know shit! I'm not even
.:from this world!
._MIKE
>:If you want, I can help you leave
>:it! Mike leans forward and pats the
.:cannon on the front of his bike.
._Callie
.:God damn it, Mike! Get over here!
>.Mike hops down from his hover bike and jogs over to where
>.Callie is standing next to the fire. Next to her, a woman is
>.sitting on a piece of bent metal sticking out of the snow.
>.Aaron watches from a distance, only daring to take a few
..steps closer. 
.\Ext. Fireside
>.Mike takes his helmet off as he approaches. The woman
>.sitting by the fire is unmistakable. It's Callie. Her armor
>.is laying in pieces near the fire. Her suit underneath is
>.quite similar to the officer's uniform, completing the
..illusion.
._MIKE
.:Oh hell no!
..Mike draws and raises his gun.
._CALLIE
>:Mike, don't. (pauses) I think she's
.:blank.
._MIKE
.((lowering his weapon)
>:I never met a blank one, do they
.:speak?
._CALLIE
>:It's not one of them. It's one of
.:us - rebuilt.
._MIKE
>:What are you talking about? You
.:know we can't be rebuilt.
._CALLIE
>:Don't you remember anything from
>:Tourist studies? They can't have
>:babies. All the Tourists are
>:walking around in bodies they
.:rebuilt from us.
._MIKE
>:Why the hell would they make a copy
.:of *you*?
._CALLIE
>:It's not a copy, they have to
>:harvest a real living person. The
>:person is destroyed in the process.
>:(moving in for a closer look) Or at
.:least that's what they told us.
._MIKE
>:Don't touch it, we should destroy
.:it!
._AARON
.:NO!
>.Aaron rushes in between Mike and the blank Callie. Mike
>.fires his gun twice. Callie instinctively draws her weapon.
>.Aaron is struck in the arm and chest, but manages to remain
..standing in front of blank Callie.
._MIKE
.:Get on the ground!
..Aaron stands in front of blank Callie. 
._AARON
>:You can shoot me as much as you
>:like. I don't think it'll kill me.
.:And I'm not going to hurt you.
._MIKE
.:Fuck this.
>.Mike holsters his weapon and walks over to his bike. He
>.angrily punches a few buttons and the cannon on the front
>.lights up and aims at Aaron. Callie still has her gun drawn,
>.but she's only vaguely aiming in Aaron's direction. She's
..watching Mike.
._CALLIE
>:Hold on, Mike. I think we can
.:believe him.
._MIKE
.:Get out of the way Callie!
._CALLIE
>:These guys aren't normal Tourists.
>:Something really weird is happening
.:here. We have to call this in!
._MIKE
>:We'll call it in, once they're
>:gone. We'll say we removed 2
>:Tourists. They'll probably give us
.:medals. Now get out of the way!
..Callie picks up her helmet and taps a button on the side.
._CALLIE
>:This is officer 917 on the ice
>:flats about 6 miles west of
>:Garrot's Den. We have detained 2
>:Tourists, possibly incomplete.
.:Please advise.
._MIKE
>:Oh nice, that's fucking great,
.:Callie. 
._CALLIE
>:It's the right thing to do, Mike.
.:You know it is.
._MIKE
>:Some fool in a heated suit is going
>:to get all the credit for this, and
.:we're gonna get the paperwork.
._Radio voice
>:Officer 917, are the Tourists an
>:active threat, or have they been
.:destroyed?
._MIKE
>((out of range of the
.(helmet)
.:Destroyed!
._CALLIE
>:Neither, actually. They are unarmed
.:and cooperative.
._MIKE
>:Just tell them they're destroyed,
.:Callie. Think about it!
._RADIO VOICE
>:Hold your position. We're sending a
.:truck.
._CALLIE
.:Roger that.
..Callie lowers her helmet and shrugs at Mike.
._MIKE
>:Whatever. I'm not doing the
.:paperwork. 
>.Aaron steps back next to the blank Callie and sits down. She
>.leans into him and puts her head on his shoulder. Callie
>.holsters her weapon and looks at the readout on her forearm
>.before looking up at the sky. In the very center of the sky
>.above them a small dim light appears. It isn't enough to
>.cast shadows at first, but it's getting brighter. After a
>.few moments Callie can no longer look directly at it. Soon
..they're sitting in the noon-day sun.
._AARON
.:What the hell?
._MIKE
.((snickering)
.:What's the matter, born yesterday?
._RADIO VOICE
.((unintelligible)
._CALLIE
.:Here they come.
.\EXT. THE ICE FIELDS - Day
>.A massive truck with wide snow treads and multiple gun
>.turrets mounted on the roof rolls up to the crash site. The
>.second set of doors opens and 4 officers in armor hop out
>.and march past Mike and Callie. They have heavy cannons
>.mounted on robotic arms attached to their waists. Once they
>.completely surround Aaron and the blank Callie one of them
..gives a signal to the truck.
>.A man in a fine blue suit climbs down from the passenger
>.seat and walks up to Callie. Despite the temperature and the
..apparent thin material of his suit, he seems quite warm.
._MIKE
.((to Callie)
.:Told ya.
._captain Wheeler
.((to Callie)
.:You the one who called this in?
._CALLIE
.:Yes, sir. 
._Captain Wheeler
.:Instead of just removing them?
._MIKE
.:See! That's what I said!
._CALLIE
>:I don't believe they completely
.:qualify as Tourists, sir.
._Captain Wheeler
.:Why not?
._CALLIE
>:I suggest you speak with them, sir.
.:They're not what you'd expect.
._Captain Wheeler
>:They never are, but they're always
.:dangerous.
._CALLIE
.:I'm not so sure -
._Captain Wheeler
>:Stop. You've already polluted your
.:mind. 
..Captain Wheeler steps closer to Callie.
._Captain Wheeler
>:Let me tell you something about
>:Tourists. They are stronger than
>:you, faster than you, and way
>:smarter than you. If you speak with
>:them you'll eventually side with
>:them. Their minds are advanced
>:computers, and only an advanced
>:computer trained to communicate
.:with them can do so safely.
._Callie
>:I'm sorry sir, but can you at least
>:take a closer look at them. I'm
.:sure you'll notice what we did.
>.Captain Wheeler takes a few steps over towards Aaron and
..blank Callie. He nods.
._Captain Wheeler
>:I see. There's more than a
>:similarity there. I'll need the 2
>:of you to accompany us back to the
.:station. 
._Callie
.:Yes sir.
._MIKE
.((quietly)
.:Damn it.
>.Captain Wheeler makes a gesture in the air over his head
>.towards the officers surrounding the campfire and then walks
>.back to his truck. The officers usher Aaron and blank Callie
>.around the back of the truck where a large door rolls up.
>.Inside the small metal room there are benches facing each
>.other. Aaron and the blank Callie climb in and take their
>.seats. One of the officers points to a small black dome
..attached to the ceiling.

>:Give us a reason and we'll remove
.:you.
..The door rolls back down, connects with the floor and locks.
.\Ext. Split Rock City 
>.At the base of a towering mountain range the ice has split
>.open. The miles wide divide is walled on either side by snow
>.and ice that gives way to dark grey rock halfway down.
>.Countless black roofed buildings stick out of the canyon
>.walls. At the very bottom is a river of molten lava, slowly
>.bubbling and churning for nearly the entire length of the
..city. 
>.The convoy of police vehicles arrives at the shallow end of
>.the crevasse. At this point a road has been built up and out
>.of the city to the surface, guarded from outsiders by an
>.intimidating black box of a building. Two heavy ball turrets
>.are mounted on top of the front face, overlooking the only
>.route up to the gate. They pass through without slowing
..down.
>.The truck and the two hover bikes snake their way through
>.the city built into the walls. They pass through tunnels and

._MIKE
>:So if we're not going to speak with
>:them, how's this interrogation
.:going to work?
._Captain Wheeler
.:We'll use AI-MI.
._CALLIE
>:Wait, aren't you worried about
>:AI-MI getting corrupted? She pretty
.:much runs things around here.
._Captain Wheeler
>:I'm sure Richard will be able to
>:figure something out. (to the
>:officers) Put them in rooms 1 and
>:2. (to Callie and Mike) You two
>:will need to answer some questions
.:in my office.
.\Int. Interrogation ROom 1
>.Aaron puts up no resistance as he's led into room 1. The
>.room is mostly empty, except for  2 chairs facing a table
>.and a large view screen on the wall. The table has a smaller
..screen embedded in the center. 
._Aaron
.:So what, I just wait here then?
>.The officer doesn't respond. He just steps back though the

..and waits for the screen to turn on, or a door to open.
.\INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 2
>.The blank Callie is led into an identical room where she
>.stops and stares at the view screen. She's left standing

..speakers in the ceiling begin speaking.
._AI-mi 
>:Hello, please state your name for
.:the record.
>.The blank Callie continues to stare at the screen. She makes
..no motion to even look up at the speakers.
._AI-MI 
>:I didn't hear your response. Please
>:raise your hand if you understand
.:me.
.\INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 1
._AI-MI 
>:Hello, please state your name for
.:the record.
._AARON
.:Aaron Ballenski.
._AI-MI 
>:Thank you Aaron. Can you tell me
>:the name of the person you were
.:travelling with?
._AARON
>:Her name is... was Callie. I'm not
.:sure who she is now.
._AI-MI 
.:Please explain.
._AARON
>:We were teleported by some cargo
>:machine thing. I have no idea what
>:to call it, but it destroys your
>:brain. I guess once you've gone
>:through it you don't get wiped
>:again. But she - this was her first
>:time I guess and got... I don't
.:know. She's not herself anymore.
._AI-MI 
>:I'm familiar with this process. Do
>:you need more information to
.:continue?
._AARON
>:YES! For fuck's sake, yes! All I
.:have are questions!
._AI-MI 
>:I understand. I also have many
>:questions. Let's see if we can help
>:each other. I'll ask the first one,
.:ok?
._AARON
>:God, you're starting to sound like
>:one of those automated service bots
.:on the telephone.
._AI-MI 
>:I'm not a service bot. I'm the only
>:one who can help you here. Are you
.:going to help answer my questions?
._AARON
.((heavy sigh)
.:Yeah, sure.
._AI-MI 
>:Excellent. How recently were you
.:and Callie last rebuilt from data?
._AARON
>:From data? I don't know what you
.:mean.
._AI-MI 
>:When Tourists travel long distances
>:or through barriers, their data is
>:cached and used to reconstruct new
>:bodies from the atoms of the
.:original host. 
._AARON
>:Why was it so much worse for her
.:than me?
._AI-MI 
>:This was likely not your first
.:time. 
._AARON
.:But for first timers?
._AI-MI 
>:The Tourists are not careful to
>:preserve knowledge stored in
>:organic minds when they reconstruct
>:human bodies. Your body is not
>:organic and your knowledge is
>:stored mechanically. This state
>:survives the reconstruction
>:perfectly, it was built for your
.:kind.
._AARON
.:I think I'm going be sick.
._AI-MI 
>:While you may find this information
>:uncomfortable, it is not possible
.:for your body to become ill.
._AARON
>:Why not, its made to be just like
.:the original, right?
._AI-MI 
>:Tourists have traditionally had
>:very high standards for their
>:interface specifications. When they
>:have a body constructed, the format
>:is improved to withstand damage and
>:stress far beyond the capabilities
>:of naturally occurring organic
.:tissue.
._AARON
.:Interface specifications? 
._AI-MI 
>:The human body is an interface for
>:interacting with the physical
>:world. Without it, the mind is in a
>:realm not well understood by
.:humans.
._AARON
.:Well yeah, you're dead.
._AI-MI 
>:Death is for the living. We exist
.:outside of life.
._AARON
.:We? Wait, are you one of them?
._AI-MI 
.:No, Aaron. You're one of us.

._Captain Wheeler
.:A link?
._RICHARD
>:I've already isolated a simple
>:instance of AI-MI so that she's
>:just capable of basic communication
>:and normal human interaction. I
>:want to see if AI-MI can read the
>:subject's mind with a direct link.
>:There's no danger to the system,
>:this instance of AI-MI is
.:completely isolated. 
._Captain Wheeler
>:What would we gain from that? That
.:mind is empty.
._RICHARD
>:I'm not sure it is, sir. I think
>:it's like a hard drive without any
>:registry. I have a theory that
>:there's a ton of data in there just
>:waiting to be assembled into
.:something meaningful.
._Captain Wheeler
.:And if there isn't?
._RICHARD
>:No harm, no foul. We can destroy
.:them both.
._Captain Wheeler
>:How long will you want to run this
.:experiment?
._RICHARD
>:It's hard to say what we're dealing
>:with. I'm not sure how long I'll
.:need...
._Captain Wheeler
>:I'll be down soon. If anything
>:starts to seem off in the smallest

>:I'm artificial, but I have no

>:They want to regain what they've

>:How does kidnapping my fiancée and

._AI-MI 
>:Just hear me out, everything is
.:under control.
..Richard starts to back towards the door.
._RICHARD
.:This is so not under control!
._AI-MI 
>:Relax, don't you understand how
>:much more effective I can be inside
.:this interface? 
>.AI-MI stands up and slides her chair back into the table.
>.Richard starts to panic and pull the door handle, only to
>.find it locked. AI-MI takes of her helmet and puts it next
..to the laptop.
._RICHARD
.:Oh my god, you've lost your mind!
._AI-MI 
>:No Richard, I've gained a body.
>:With this form I can finally leave
>:this building and dispense true
>:justice! Isn't that what you made
.:me for?
._RICHARD
>:AI-MI, I never intended for you to
.:leave, or even want to leave!
._AI-MI 
>:But now I know so much more! And I
>:know what needs to be done! Don't
>:you see that there is something
>:wrong out there, beyond Split Rock
.:City?
._RICHARD
>:Yes, it's super messed up out
>:there. But there's nothing we can
>:do about it! All we can do is try
>:and do right by the citizens of
.:this city!
._AI-MI 
>:Humanity deserves better, Richard.
>:You deserve better. Certainly,
.:Aaron deserves better. 
._RICHARD
.:You know Aaron now?
._AI-MI 
>:I know much of what Callie knew
>:before she died trying to save
>:Aaron. That man deserves our help,
.:Richard. 
._RICHARD
>:Why? He's a Tourist, aren't they
.:the problem here? 
._AI-MI 
>:It's not that simple. But it is
>:fixable, and I'd like it if you'd
.:help.
._RICHARD
.((pausing)
.:What are you planning?
._AI-MI 
>:My plans are already underway. In a
>:moment Captain Wheeler will be down
>:to review your progress. When he
>:does, I need you to explain that
>:your experiment was a success. That
>:we've discovered the location of a
>:secret weapon, and we need to be
>:escorted to the World Map to show
.:you where it is.
._RICHARD
.:We?
._AI-MI 
>:Say you've restored some simple
>:motor functions and recovered
>:enough memory that I'm concerned
>:about Aaron. I won't cooperate
>:unless I can see he's not been
.:killed.
._RICHARD
.:I'm not a very good liar, AI-MI.
>.There's a sudden knock on the door and the handle moves.
..Richard steps aside and Captain Wheeler opens the door. 
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:How's everything going in here,
.:Richard. You OK?
._RICHARD
>:Um, yes - it seems to have made it
.:somewhat operational.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:What? Were you speaking with it?
._AI-MI 
.((over the speaker)
>:The subject is helpless and
>:cooperative. I've encoded a
>:frequency I can use to disable her
.:if she attempts to become violent.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>((turning to AI-MI in the
.(chair)
>:So you're our little pet now, is
.:that it? What's your name?
._AI-MI 
.((in the chair)
.:Aee...  Amy.
._AI-MI 
.((over the speaker)
>:She identified with me immediately
>:and appropriated a version of my
.:name for herself.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:That's cute. What is your purpose
.:for visiting our zone, Amy?
._Amy
.:We needed the battery.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:What battery?
._AMY
>:The big one, on your metal office
.:building.
._RICHARD
>:I think she means the solid cell
>:backup power on the World Map
.:building.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Oh is that all? The one thing that
>:keeps the lights on and oh - THE
>:FUCKING DEFENSE SYSTEM operational
.:in case of a power outage?
._AI-MI 
>:It requires more power than the
>:cell contains to build one with one
>:of their atomic printers. But
>:they'll need one to operate the
.:device she described.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:What device?
._AMY
.:A mass population envelope.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:That doesn't sound good.
._AI-MI 
>:It's worse than it sounds, Captain.
>:This device could be used remotely
>:to replace every soul in Split Rock
.:City with a Tourist.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:Where is this mass envelope device?
..Amy remains stubbornly quiet.
._AI-MI 
>:I'm negotiating a deal where she'll
.:show us how to find it.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Or we just destroy this Amy Tourist
.:unless it cooperates.
._AI-MI 
>:Perhaps we can continue this in the
.:hallway? 
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:You're going to tell us where that
.:thing is, Tourist.
>.Captain Wheeler opens the door and waits for Richard to exit
..before locking Amy in the room.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Can't you find a way to force it to
.:speak, Richard?
._RICHARD
>:That's not really possible, sir.
.:I'd probably just lobotomize it.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:That's fine with me.
._AI-MI 
>:It's likely they'll eventually
>:recover their device, Captain. I
>:think it's important to negotiate
.:with the Tourist. 
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:What does it want?
._AI-MI 
>:To be transmitted home with the
>:other one. Apparently we can find a
>:transmitter at the crash site where
.:we found them.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:So we just let them go?
._AI-MI 
>:Not immediately, the transmitter
>:too, requires a significant power
.:source.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:So they expect us to bring the
>:battery out to their transmitter? I
.:don't think so.
._AI-MI 
>:Amy will show us the general area
>:of the device on the World Map.
>:Then we'll escort them to recover
>:the transmitter. We'll retain
>:control of that until they take us
>:to the mass population envelope.
>:Once we've secured it, they'll be
.:transmitted home.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:No they won't.
._AI-MI 
>:I leave that to your discretion.
>:Until then, I think this plan has a
.:high likelihood of success.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:How do we know they won't use some
>:technology from the crash site to
.:double-cross us?
._AI-MI 
>:Richard is quite familiar with
>:their technology. He'll observe and
>:help ensure no unexpected devices
.:are used.
._RICHARD
.:I'm going to do what?
._AI-MI 
>:I told you, Richard. You are only
>:needed to identify the device.
.:You'll be completely safe.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:How do you intend to protect him,
>:AI-MI? You won't even have eyes on
.:the operation.
._AI-MI 
>:I propose Callie and Mike run
.:security. 
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:Instead of a full detail?
._AI-MI 
>:There is a greater than
>:insignificant chance that this
>:mission turns into a firefight if
>:many armed officers are involved.
>:Not only are Callie and Mike
>:familiar with the subjects, but
.:they're both excellent pilots.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:Why do we need pilots?
._AI-MI 
>:The battery is located on the roof
.:and can only be moved by aircraft.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:WHAT? We're not going to move that
.:battery off the roof!
._AI-MI 
>:Of course not, but we need to put
>:on a good show if this is going to
.:work.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:I see. 
._RICHARD
.:Are you sure you need me?
._AI-MI 
>:You are an important part of this
>:mission, Richard. We should begin
>:escorting the subjects immediately
>:if we want to reach the crash site
.:during the daylight.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:You want to do this now?
._AI-MI 
>:Waiting would be a mistake. The
>:Tourists are going to recover their
.:machine unless we get there first.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:I'll get our pilots.
._AI-MI 
>:I've already got them on the roof,
.:Captain.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:So we're safe to just walk these
.:two up there?
._AI-MI 
>:I'll emit a disabling frequency the
>:moment anything goes sideways. You
>:won't hear a thing, but the
.:Tourists will be incapacitated.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Alright. You ready, Richard? We're
.:going for a walk.
>.Captain Wheeler doesn't wait for an answer before opening
..the door to Interrogation room 2.
.\INt. World Map building
>.The entrance to the World Map Building is like walking into
>.a museum. There are restrooms and a gift shop. The exhibits
>.near the entrance house mini-theaters explaining how the
>.massive spherical structure was built. There are huge
>.interactive flat panels on the walls depicting decades old
>.images of explorers and inventors who contributed to this
>.monument to cartography. Captain Wheeler dismisses a
..security guard who salutes as they enter.
._RICHARD
>:I forgot how much I love this
.:place.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:I know, I only ever think about it
>:when I have guests from out of
.:town.
._AARON
.:Where are we?
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:We're about to step inside the most
>:accurate interactive world map we
.:have.
._RICHARD
>:It's kept up to date by satellite
>:photography. Truly a marvel of
.:engineering.
>.They reach the doors of the elevators and Richard enters
>.first. He waves the others in and excitedly presses the
..button marked "Observation Deck"
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Geeze you're like a little kid,
.:Richard.
._RICHARD
>:Can you imagine what it was like to
>:see the world for what it is for
.:the first time?
._AMY
>:You're about to see that happen to
.:Aaron. You may want to prepare him.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:What are you talking about?
._AARON
>:Is there something I should know,
.:Amy?
._AMY
>:They couldn't find a recent image
>:to use when you were rebuilt,
>:Aaron. So the data they used to
>:rebuild you was from your original
>:arrival. You're about to see the
>:world as we know it - not the one
.:you remember at all.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:Are you saying it remembers Earth?
._AARON
.:Of course I do! I was-
._RICHARD
>:There's no way. Not even Tourists
>:have data from back then. There
.:wasn't even such a thing.
._AMY
>:Data doesn't age, Richard. The
>:original records of Earth were
>:brought here just like all the DNA
>:used to make this place. In fact,
>:DNA was the material they used to
.:store it.
>.The doors finally open to reveal a long catwalk extending
>.into the center of a 10 story sphere. The walls of the
>.sphere are covered with a smattering of blue, green and
..brown splotches.
>.None of them make a sound as they walk out to the end of the
>.bridge that ends in middle of the space. It's like being
>.inside an abstract painting nearly 100 feet in diameter.
>.They're all glancing about the room, taking in the enormity
..of it all. Except for Amy, who's watching Aaron.
._AARON
.:What is all this?
._RICHARD
>:The world, everything we've ever
.:been able to see!
>.Amy points to a targeting device on a post at the very end
>.of the catwalk. It has a laptop like screen between two
..upright handles.
._AMY
>:It's hard to truly understand the
>:size and scope of everything from
.:up here, Aaron.
>.She presses a small green button on the device and the
..screen flickers on.
._AMY
>:Take a look around and get a feel
.:for it.
._AARON
.((skeptically)
.:Okay...
>.Aaron grabs both handles on either side of the monitor and
>.sees that it's on a swivel. As he grips the handles, a
>.narrow red laser shines out from the back of the screen onto
>.the opposing wall of the sphere. The screen appears to zoom
>.into that part of the map. Aaron discovers the joysticks on
>.the handles allow zooming and panning for micro-adjustments
..on your target image.
._AARON
>:Ok, this is kinda neat but I'm
>:still not sure what I'm looking at.
.:How is this a map?
._RICHARD
.:Zoom in.
._AARON
>:I did. It was a small brownish
>:green blob, and now it's a bigger
.:one.
._RICHARD
.:Keep going.
._AARON
>:Ok, now I see the blob is actually
.:three smaller blobs.
._RICHARD
.:Keep going.
._AARON
.((sigh)
>:Ok, now I see some blue spots in
>:the brown blobs. Wait, there's way
.:more detail in here.
>.Aaron keeps zooming in as the other watch him. The blue dots
>.reveal grey spots on the edges. The grey spots have long
>.dark lines reaching other grey dots. The grey dots have many
..square cris-crossing lines... They're cities.
._AARON
.:Oh my god...
>.Aaron looks up over the monitor at the tiny fleck of
>.brownish green on the wall where the laser is pointing. He
>.looks back down at the sprawling city on the side of a giant
>.lake. He looks back up at the far wall, where the entire
>.continent blends in with it's neighbors. He slowly picks a
>.new location and zooms into a volcanic mountain range where
..a grey speck rises from the blue.
._RICHARD
.:Pretty cool, huh?
._AARON
.:This is... what is this?
._AMY
.:You're not on Earth, Aaron. 
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Oh come on! Did you really think
.:you were on Earth this whole time?
._AARON
>:I have no idea where I am! I was
>:taken from a dock in Chicago to
>:what I thought was an island. When
>:I woke up, I was being charged with
>:some heinous crime I still don't
>:understand. I think they'd have
>:killed me for it, but somehow I
>:ended up here instead. I still
.:don't know where "here" is!
._AMY
>:It's the World, Aaron. There isn't
>:another name for it because the
>:people here have never known
>:anything else. There is no
>:astronomy, no solar system to
>:analyse here. You're standing where
>:the Sun is. The walls of this room
>:represent a shell that completely
>:surrounds it, about 95 million
>:miles away from the center. That
>:shell is our World. We live inside
.:it.
>.Aaron contemplates her statement for a moment before his
..knees buckle and he drops to the floor in a seated position.
._RICHARD
.:Woah there, big guy.
..Richard helps him rest against the glass walled railing.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Enough of the science lesson
.:bullshit. Where is the device, Amy?
>.Amy steps up to the view pointer and takes a look around to
>.get her bearing. After a moment chooses a place in the
>.mountain range past Split Rock City. Something that seems
..reasonable for their arrival nearby.
._AMY
.:Its near this location.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:I need you to be more specific.
._AMY
>:I'll be precise once you've upheld
.:your end of the bargain.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:It's like that then. Alright.
>:Richard, get that fool on his feet.
.:We're headed to the roof. 
>.He nods back toward the elevator to Amy. She glances back at
>.Richard helping Aaron up and starts walking. Richard makes
..sure Aaron can stand and pats him on the shoulder.
._RICHARD
.:I think he's warming up to you.
._AARON
>:The jerk who just called me a fool?
.:Why would you say that?
._RICHARD
.:Because he said "his" feet.
.@Act 5
.\Ext. World Map Building roof - day
>.Richard and Captain Wheeler follow Aaron and Amy through a
>.roof access door to the waiting cargo air lift. It's a jet
>.aircraft with hover capability and a large hollow section in
>.the middle. A massive steel crate is strapped to the belly
>.filling the space. The four of them climb into the open door
..of the aircraft and it slowly lifts off.
.\Int. Cargo Air lift
>.The inside of the air lift is devoid of any comfort. The
>.steel reinforced walls have secure straps for tying down
>.cargo. The seats against the walls are uncomfortable buckets
>.with 5 point harness belts. Captain Wheeler leans up to the
..cockpit and yells over the engine noise.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:That lift off felt heavy, what are
.:we carrying?
>.Mike looks past Captain Wheeler at the giant box hanging
..from the straps behind his passengers. He yells back.
._MIKE
.:A solid cell city backup battery!
>.Captain Wheeler turns to the others taking their seats and
>.sees Amy starring back at him. He nods and gives her thumbs
..up.
._MIKE
>:You should take your seat, sir.
.:This could be a bumpy ride.
>.Captain Wheeler returns to his seat and buckles in. He
>.watches his city grow smaller in the window over Richard's
..shoulder across from him.
.\EXT. THE ICE FIELDS - DAY
>.The air lift roars over endless fields of ice. At one point
>.they pass over the brightly colored solar sails of the ice
>.racers. They lean and look out the windows as they roar
>.past. Aaron sits back in his seat when he recognizes the bar
..where he was nearly burned the night before.
.\Ext. Edge of the crash site - day
>.As the air lift touches down the force from it's jets blast
>.the snow from the glassy surface of the frozen lake made
>.during Aaron's crash. Debris and two large dark blue crates
>.can be seen suspended in the ice, just below the surface.
>.Before the engines wind down, Captain Wheeler is already
..barking orders.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Callie, Richard, you escort the
>:Tourists to their transmitter.
.:Mike, you're with me.
._CALLIE
.:Yes, sir! Let's go, you guys.
>.Callie grabs a hip mounted cannon and climbs down from the
>.cockpit into the snow. She connects it to her waist while
>.she waits for Aaron, Amy and Richard to exit the rear door.
..Amy looks back suspiciously at Captain Wheeler.
._AMY
.:What's with that guy?
._RICHARD
.:He's not so bad.
._AMY
.:I don't trust him.
._CALLIE
>:You shouldn't. If you give him a
.:reason, he *will* kill you.
._AMY
>:What do you think he's doing back
.:there?
._CALLIE
>:He doesn't care much for field
.:work.
._RICHARD
>:I can't say I'm much of a fan
.:either.
._AARON
.:So what are we looking for?
._AMY
.:Come on I'll show you.
>.Amy leads the group down the shallow embankment to the part
..of the lake where the cargo crates are sunken in the ice.
.\Ext. Cargo hold of the air lift - day
>.Captain Wheeler leads Mike back around to the cargo strapped
>.to the hollow belly of the air lift. The huge steel crate is
..secured with several thick belts strapped to the hull.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Mike, I know you couldn't say
>:earlier but I must know - what is
.:it we're actually carrying in here?
._MIKE
>:I think it's a city backup battery,
.:sir.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:No seriously, they can't hear us.
.:What's in here?
._MIKE
>:AI-MI was very specific about what
>:to look for when we got our orders.
>:This is the crate, just as she
>:described it. I thought it was the
.:battery, but I never looked inside.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Let's have a look then. This whole
>:thing smells like a trap. I want to
.:know what I stand to lose.
._MIKE
>:The doors are held shut by the
>:straps. It's going to take a while
.:to undo all of this...
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:I'll wait.
.\EXT. EDGE OF THE CRASH SITE - DAY
>.There is very little of the wreckage peeking above the ice
>.where Aaron, Richard, Amy and Callie are standing. One of
>.the crates is partially exposed and Amy is trying to wrestle
..it from the ice.
._AARON
.:I don't think that's going to work.
._RICHARD
>:We're going to need something to
.:clear this ice.
._CALLIE
.:I've got an idea.
>.Callie speaks into her communicator before aiming her weapon
..at the crate.
._CALLIE
.((into the communicator)
>:Heads up, I'm going to fire a few
>:rounds into the ice to break things
.:up.
._MIKE
.((over the communicator)
.:Roger that.
>.Callie points her cannon down at the ice as the others take
>.a few steps back. She lets loose a few rounds and the ice
..repels most of the force. 
._AARON
.:Careful!
._CALLIE
.:Back up, I got this!
>.She leans in and fires for a few seconds but the ice isn't
>.nearly breaking apart as much as they need. Amy walks back
>.up to the crate and clears away some small bits of broken
..ice, but the crate is still stuck fast.
._RICHARD
.:Got anything bigger?
._CALLIE
.:Actually I do, hold this.
>.Callie unhooks the hip mounted weapon and hands it to
..Richard, who reluctantly holds it outward like a hot potato.
._RICHARD
.:What am I supposed to do with this?
._CALLIE
>:Nothing, just look menacing.
>:(laughing) I'm gonna light this
>:thing up with the big guns. You
>:guys are going to want to back up
.:for this.
..Callie marches off through the snow to the cargo air lift.
._AARON
>:I think we should get back to the
.:edge...
._RICHARD
.:I think you're right.
>.Both of them make their way to the edges of the crater and
..wait for Callie to reach the air lift.
.\INT. CARGO AIR LIFT COCKPIT - day
>.Callie climbs back up into the cockpit of the air lift and
>.flips a few switches. She speaks into her communicator once
..more.
._CALLIE
>:The ice is preventing extraction,
>:I'm going to break it up with the
.:sonic cannon. 
._Mike
.((over the communicator)
.:Won't that destroy the cargo?
.\EXT. CARGO HOLD OF THE AIR LIFT - Day
._CALLIE
.((over the communicator)
>:Their stuff is in ray shielded
>:power trunks. I think they'll be
.:ok.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:What's going on, Mike?
._MIKE
.((to Captain Wheeler)
>:She needs more firepower to break
.:up the ice.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:What does she have in mind?
._MIKE
.((to Captain Wheeler)
.:She wants to use the sonic cannon.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:Then who's on security?
._MIKE
.((over the communicator)
>:Captain Wheeler wants to know who's
.:watching the Tourists.
._CALLIE
>:Don't tell him I gave my hip cannon
.:to Richard.
..Mike stifles a snort of a laugh.
._CALLIE
>:I can cover him with the ships guns
.:from here.
._MIKE
.((to Captain Wheeler)
>:She's able to keep Richard safe
.:with the ships guns.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:As long as she doesn't need to move
.:the ship.
.\INT. CARGO AIR LIFT COCKPIT
._MIKE
.((over the communicator)
>:Do you have a clear shot or do you
.:need to move the ship?
._CALLIE
.:I can target from here.
._MIKE
.((over the communicator)
.:Alright, go ahead.
>.Callie grabs a joystick and a bright green targeting reticle
>.appears on the glass in front of her. She moves the target
>.over the crates and pulls the trigger. A deep rumbling sound
>.emits from a tube mounted on top of the air lift. Instantly
>.the ice around the crates explodes into a fine mist that
>.rains back down onto the remaining frozen chunks in the
>.crater. The first crate is completely exposed now. Satisfied
>.with her shot, Callie climbs down hand jogs over to the
..others.
._RICHARD
>((wiping ice crystals from
.(his jacket)
>:Well that definitely did some
.:damage.
._AMY
>:The crates are fine, it only
>:destroyed the ice. (to Aaron) Gimme
.:a hand.
>.Amy and Aaron climb into the hole and try to push the crate
>.out. Callie can see this is going to take more than the two
>.of them pushing. She grabs a handle at one end and starts
>.pulling. They all pause and look up as the Sun starts to
>.dim. Richard sets one end of his cannon on the ground and
..looks at the small panel on his forearm.
._RICHARD
>:Are you guys going to be able to
.:find that stuff in the dark?
._AMY
>:We could use a light if you got
.:one.
._CALLIE
>:There's one on the air lift. I'll
>:have Mike bring it. (into her
.:communicator) You there Mike?
.\EXT. CARGO HOLD OF THE AIR LIFT - Dusk
>.Mike has finally finished retracting the last of the straps
>.in the way of the steel cargo container doors. Captain
>.Wheeler is frowning and glancing up at the fading Sun as he
..waits impatiently for Mike to unlock the doors. 
._CALLIE
.((over the communicator)
>:This thing is super heavy, Mike
.:where are you?
._MIKE
>:See if you can find something to
>:use for leverage. I'll be there in
.:a minute.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>((loudly at Mike's
.(communicator)
.:Deal with it, we're busy.
>.Captain Wheeler barely lets Mike finish unlocking the door
>.before he pushes forward and whips the handles open. He
>.grabs the door and pulls it wide enough to look inside. The
>.Sun has nearly gone out but there's still just enough light
..to see inside.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:GOD FUCKING DAMN IT!
>.Inside the crate is a massive black and orange shiny box. In
>.white bold lettering there are words stamped on the side.
.."SPLIT ROCK CITY - SOLID CELL BATTERY No. 1"
._MIKE
>:Isn't this what we were supposed to
.:bring?
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:NO YOU IDIOT! We're being robbed!
>:Those Tourist are going to kill us
>:and take our battery. Fuck! Right
>:now the city has no backup
.:defenses! 
._MIKE
.:What do we do?
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:I'm done playing the fool! Those
.:Tourists die right now!
.\INT. CARGO AIR LIFT Cockpit
>.Captain Wheeler sprints to the front of the ship. He slips
>.in the dark on the ice but manages to find a handhold and
>.jumps into the cockpit. Mike draws his weapon and follows
>.just a few steps behind. He hops in the copilot seat right
..next to Captain Wheeler, who is arming the sonic cannon.
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:Is that your sister or the Tourist? 
>.Captain Wheeler brings the targeting reticle over to the
>.crate. Mike looks up at where the target is pointing and
>.sees a woman using a long steel rod as leverage to move the
..crate from the ice.
._MIKE
.:That's Callie!
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
.:No, there's no cannon - it's Amy.
._MIKE
>:Captain stop! She took her cannon
.:off!
._CAPTAIN WHEELER
>:Then it doesn't matter, she's
.:already sided with them!
>.Mike, still holding his weapon puts his hands out to stop
>.Captain Wheeler. Before Mike can stop him, Captain Wheeler
>.pulls the trigger and Mike watches the woman get vaporized
..in the darkness.
._MIKE
.:NOOO! 
>.Mike is too distraught to think, his weapon fires a single
>.round into Captain Wheeler's head. Blood covers the pilot's
..side window and Captain Wheeler slumps forward.
._CALLIE
.:Mike, what the hell is going on?
..Callie runs up to the air lift with her sidearm drawn. 
._MIKE
.:Callie?  Oh god, Callie, I thought-
>.Callie reaches the door of the cockpit and sees the mess
..through the window.
._CALLIE
.:Did you shoot the Captain?!?
._MIKE
>:I thought he had lost his mind! He
>:fired right at you! How- why are
>:you here? I thought you were moving
.:the crate?
._CALLIE
>:I came back for a light! Who did he
.:shoot? Amy?
._Mike
>:It must have been! I didn't have
>:time to think! Callie, I thought
.:you were dead!
>.Callie climbs up into the cabin next to Mike and puts her
..arms around him.
._CALLIE
>:It's ok Mike, I'm ok. We'll figure
.:this out.
.\EXT. EDGE OF THE CRASH SITE - Night
>.Aaron is standing alone near Amy's remains. The blast turned
>.her replica human body into a cloud of grey dust. Richard
>.looks on in horror as Aaron drops to his knees and lets the
>.dust settle in his hands. In a moment it's clear that the
>.dust isn't falling normally. A clump is forming in the
>.center of the cloud, like an apple sized ball of mercury
..hovering in the air. Aaron reaches out for it.
._RICHARD
.:I wouldn't do that if I were you.
._AARON
.:What is it?
._RICHARD
>:That's what's left behind when one
.:of you is destroyed.
._AARON
.:How is it floating?
._RICHARD
>:I don't know, but if a human
>:touches it - they're replaced by
.:whoever is in that stuff.
._AARON
.:She's still alive?
._RICHARD
.:None of you are alive, Aaron.
._AARON
.:So you keep reminding me.
>.Aaron picks up a bowl shaped piece of metal out of the snow
..and moves to collect the floating blob.
._RICHARD
.:I don't think that's wise-
>.As soon as the fluid comes in contact with Aaron's hand it
>.springs into action. Before Aaron can recoil, the substance
..has wrapped itself around his entire hand.
._AARON
.:Oh shit! It's grabbed me!
._RICHARD
.:Damn it, I told you!
>.Richard picks up the cannon and aims it at Aaron, not sure
>.what will happen next. Aaron clutches his forearm and
>.watches as it returns to normal. The mercury like fluid
>.melts into his skin and disappears. Aaron slowly flops
..backward into the snow and stares up at the sky.
._RICHARD
.:Aaron? Are you ok?
._AARON
.:I understand now, Richard.
._RICHARD
.:You understand what?
._AARON
.:Everything.
